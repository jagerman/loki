class MatchScreen:
    """
    Provides a call operator that matches each device line against a regex for the line.  Can
    optionally invoke callback when all the regexes match, e.g. to perform additional checks or
    extract data.  Note that regexes use .search, so should be anchored with ^ as needed.

    If allow_extra is given and True then the `ledger.curr()` is permitted to return results longer
    than the regex list; only the first `len(regexes)` elements are tested.

    If fail_index is given it should be an index >= 1 from which mismatches should be considered
    fatal: if the items before `fail_index` match the screen, then the ones from `fail_index`
    onwards *must* match or else we fatally fail with an exception.  This can be used, for example,
    to match something like `['Confirm Amount', '123']`: using fail_index=1 we would immediately
    fail (with exception) the test if we see `Confirm Amount` on the screen with any other value.
    (Without fail_index, we would keep re-testing the screen in such a case).

    If callback is specified and has a return value then it is cast that to bool and return it.  If
    not specified, has no return, or returns None then True is returned after calling the callback.

    callback, if given, will be invoked as `callback(curr_text, match_objects)` and can:
    - return a truthy value, None, or no return value to pass the interaction/match and proceed to
      the next interaction
    - return a falsey value (other than None) to fail the match and repeat the interaction
    - throw an exception to fail the test
