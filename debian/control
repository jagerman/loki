Description: Loki shared libraries
 This package contains the common Loki library code used by the various loki
 binaries.

Package: libloki-core-wallet8.0.1
Architecture: any
Depends: libloki-core8.0.1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Loki wallet shared libraries
 This package contains the common Loki library code used by the various loki
 wallet-related code.

Package: lokid

Depends: libloki-core8.0.1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, debconf
Suggests: loki-blockchain-tools, loki-wallet-cli
Description: Loki network daemon
 This package contains the loki network daemon, lokid, for running a loki node
 or loki service node.

Package: loki-wallet-cli
Architecture: any
Depends: libloki-core-wallet8.0.1 (= ${binary:Version}), libloki-core8.0.1 (= ${binary:Version}),
    ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: lokid
Description: Loki command-line wallet and JSON RPC wallet
 This package contains binaries for accessing a wallet stored on the Loki
 blockchain.  Both a command-line interface (loki-wallet-cli) and a JSON RPC
 interface (loki-wallet-rpc) are provided.
 .
 The wallets require a lokid node to work, such as the one provided in the
 lokid package, but can also work with a remote Loki node.

Package: loki-wallet-rpc
Architecture: any
Depends: libloki-core-wallet8.0.1 (= ${binary:Version}), libloki-core8.0.1 (= ${binary:Version}),
    ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: lokid
Description: Loki RPC wallet
 This package contains the Loki JSON RPC wallet interface to accessing a wallet
 on the Loki blockchain.  This wallet interface is typically used by external
 software that needs to interact with a wallet.
 .
 The wallet requires a lokid node to work, such as the one provided in the
 lokid package, but can also work with a remote Loki node.

Package: loki-blockchain-tools

    ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: lokid
Description: Loki blockchain utilities
 This contains the loki-blockchain-* binaries for managing and querying the
 loki blockchain database.  These tools are not typically needed to run an
 ordinary node or service node.

Package: libloki-core-dev
